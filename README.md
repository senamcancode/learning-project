# Java Learning Journal 
This repository is my personal space for consolidating and applying concepts from: 
- ** Effective Java by Joshua Block
- ** NeetCode ** Design Patterns

The goal is to move beyond passive learning and: 
- Implement core Java concepts and design principles
- Solve algorithmic problems using Java
